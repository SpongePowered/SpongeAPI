Contribution Guidelines
=======================
We will always have a need for developers to help us improve SpongeAPI. There is no such thing as a perfect project and things can always be improved. If you are a developer and are interested in helping then please do not hesitate. Just make sure you follow our guidelines.

Overall, our guidelines strongly follow those of [Google's Java Style Guidelines](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) with a few modifications.

You can also download our formatting xml files. Links for both are in our [contributing doc] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1afZMMsU9yODX6d6WZAiKnabMbkuDXa_3ulsuDKZcfxg/edit).

## Modifications & Comments
* Line endings
  * Use Unix line endings when committing (\n)
    * Windows users of Git can do: `git config --global core.autocrlf true`
* Column width
  * 80 for Javadocs
  * 150 for code
  * Feel free to wrap when it will help with readability
* Import order
  * Use Google’s, You will have to configure this in your IDE.
    * IntelliJ IDEA: `Settings → Project Settings → Code Style → Java → Imports`
    * NetBeans: `Options → Editor → Formatting → Java → Imports`
* Indentation
  * Use only four spaces for indentations, do not use two spaces
* Vertical whitespace
  * Place a blank line before the first member of a class (i.e. after `class Example {`)
  * A line after the last member of a class is encouraged but not required
  * Applies to interfaces, enums, etc. as well
* File headers
  * File headers must be surrounded in a block comment (`/* */`) and follow the style in other code files.
* Exceptions
  * For exceptions that are to be ignored, name the exception variable ignored or ignore
* Javadocs
  * Do NOT use `@author`
  * End paragraphs with `</p>`
  * Capitalize the first letter in the descriptions within each "at clause", i.e. `@param name Player to affect`


## Code Conventions
* Annotation usage:
  * All methods that return null MUST be annotated with `@Nullable` (from javax.*)
  * All method parameters that accept null MUST be annotated with `@Nullable`
  * Use [Google Preconditions](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/PreconditionsExplained), especially as a guard against unexpected nulls, in all public facing APIs: `checkNotNull(param);`
  * All implemented or overridden methods MUST be annotated with `@Override`
* For parameters, make them final by default unless they are going to be modified
* If something needs to logged, get a logger from log4j on the current class


## The Gist
While we urge that you read Google's Java conventions particularly, the two are fairly long documents. To get you started quickly, here is an example of properly formatted code...

```
/* 
 * Licensing 
 */

package com.example.java;

/* imports */

/**
 * An Example class which shows the required formatting
 */
public class Example {

   private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(ExampleClass.class);
   private static final Random random = new Random();
   private final String id = "test";

   /**
    * Returns an identifier approximately half of the time.
    *
    * <p>A static instance of {@link Random} is used to calculate the
    * outcome with a 50% chance. If the outcome is to not return the ID,
    * the given fallback ID is returned.</p>
    *
    * @param fallback An optional fallback name to return
    *        if the random boolean returns false
    * @return The ID half of the time, the given fallback the other half
    */
   @Nullable
   public String resolveId(@Nullable String fallback) {
       logger.log(Priority.INFO, "ID requested");

       if (random.nextBoolean()) {
           return id;
       } else {
           return fallback;
       }
   }
}
```

Heres an example of a properly formatted code in an interface:

```
/*
 * Licensing
 */
 
package org.spongepowered.api.component.attribute;

/**
 * An Example interface which shows the required formatting
 */
public interface Example extends AnotherInterface, ExampleInterface {

    /**
     * Gets the name of the {@link Entity}.
     *
     * @param entity The entity
     * @return The entity name
     * @throws NonExistingEntityException The error caused when the entity
     *         does not exist
     */
    String getName(Entity entity) throws NonExistingEntityException;

    /**
     * Set the health amount.
     *
     * <p>The range of the health depends on the object on which this
     * method is defined. For players in Minecraft, the nominal range is
     * between 0 and 20, inclusive, but the range can be adjusted.</p>
     *
     * <p>Convention dictates that health does not follow below 0 but this
     * convention may be broken.</p>
     *
     * @param health The health to set to
     */
    void setHealth(double health);

    /**
     * Checks to see if {@link Entity} is alive.
     *
     * @return true If entity is alive
     */
    boolean isAlive(Entity entity);
}
```
