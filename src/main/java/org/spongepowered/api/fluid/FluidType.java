/**
 * The functional equivalent of an {@link ItemType} or {@link BlockType},
 * except for fluids. Normally, the gameplay mechanics of fluids are entirely
 * dependent on the implementation of a fluid; however, they are representable
 * as {@link FluidStack}s, where a certain amount of a {@link FluidType} for
 * a specified volume "exists" within a {@link Keys#FLUID_TANK_CONTENTS Fluid Tank Value}.
 *
 * <p>Normally, {@link Keys#FLUID_TANK_CONTENTS} can be either retrieved from
 * either a {@link BlockState} or {@link BlockEntity} that specifically handles
 * fluids. Depending on the implementation, a fluid stack may be used differently
 * than how vanilla implementations handle them.</p>
