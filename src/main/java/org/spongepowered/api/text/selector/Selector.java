/**
 * Represents an immutable selector of targets, as used in commands.
 *
 * <p>
 * In Vanilla, selectors are mostly represented as plain text, starting with an
 * {@code @} symbol and followed by a single character signifying the type, and
 * finally the (optional) arguments in brackets.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As an example, the all player selector is {@code @a}, and with a radius of
 * 20 it would be {@code @a[r=20]}.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Additionally, Vanilla will ignore position data unless one of the following
 * arguments is present:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ArgumentTypes#POSITION}</li>
 *   <li>{@link ArgumentTypes#DIMENSION}</li>
 *   <li>{@link ArgumentTypes#RADIUS}</li>
 * </ul>
 * All {@code resolve} methods have a look-alike named {@code resolveForce}
 * which always uses the given position data.
 * </p>
