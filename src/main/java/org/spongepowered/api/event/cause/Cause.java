/**
 * A cause represents the reason or initiator of an event.
 *
 * <p>For example, if a block of sand is placed where it drops, the block
 * of sand would create a falling sand entity, which then would place another
 * block of sand. The block place event for the final block of sand would have
 * the cause chain of the block of sand -&gt; falling sand entity.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is not possible to accurately the describe the chain of causes in
 * all scenarios so a best effort approach is generally acceptable. For
 * example, a player might press a lever, activating a complex Redstone
 * circuit, which would then launch TNT and cause the destruction of
 * some blocks, but tracing this event would be too complicated and thus
 * may not be attempted.</p>
