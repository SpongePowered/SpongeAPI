/**
 * Fired when a game client has authenticated with the server.
 *
 * <p>This event is fired asynchronously, i.e. not in the main thread.</p>
 *
 * <p>After the event is fired, the login state switches to
 * {@code READY_TO_ACCEPT} and the thread dies. (The main thread then
 * acknowledges the {@code READY_TO_ACCEPT} state and proceeds to firing
 * {@link GameClientConnectEvent}). The event is triggered after the encryption
 * response is sent from the client, see
 * http://wiki.vg/Protocol#Encryption_Response for more info.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cancelling the event will prevent the client from joining and show
 * {@link #getDisconnectMessage} to the client.</p>
