/**
 * Fired when a game client attempts to connect to the server.
 *
 * <p>This event is fired after {@link GameClientAuthEvent}, and in the main
 * thread.</p>
 *
 * <p>This event fires during the login process when the login state is
 * {@code READY_TO_ACCEPT} - after the token has been verified but before the
 * connection state switches to 'play'. See
 * http://wiki.vg/Protocol#Login_Success for the protocol info.</p>
 *
 * <p>The server may have cancelled the event if the client's profile or IP is
 * banned or not on the whitelist (if these features are enabled). Be sure to
 * set {@code ignoreCancelled = false} in the {@code @Subscribe} annotation to
 * receive the event in this case.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cancelling the event will prevent the client from joining and show
 * {@link #getDisconnectMessage} to the client.</p>
