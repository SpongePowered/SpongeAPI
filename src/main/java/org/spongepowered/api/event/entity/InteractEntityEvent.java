    interface Secondary extends InteractEntityEvent {}

    /**
     * Represents the base event for when an {@link Entity} is being
     * "attacked". The uniqueness of this event is that all
     * {@link DamageSource}s can deal varying amounts of damage with varying
     * modifiers based on various reasons. Due to this ambiguous variety of
     * information that is possible to provide, the {@link Attack}
     * can be summarized as so:
     *
     * <p>An {@link Arrow},
     *  that was shot by a {@link Skeleton},
     *    with an enchanted {@link ItemTypes#BOW} {@link ItemStack},
     *  when the {@link World} {@link Difficulty} was set to
     *  {@link Difficulties#HARD},
     * will deal possibly "5" damage to any {@link Entity} it hits.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>The issue with representing this type of "logic flow" is that a
     * particular amount of damage from a {@link DamageSource}, even if
     * specified to a particular {@link DamageType}, has no static finalized
     * amount of damage to deal to a particular {@link Entity}. To properly
     * represent this, a {@link DamageSource} has various "states" such as:
     * {@link DamageSource#isAbsolute()} or
     * {@link DamageSource#isBypassingArmor()}. Quite simply, the
     * {@link DamageSource} will always be the "first" element within a
     * {@link Cause} that can be retrieved from {@link #getCause()}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Next, any additional "aides" in attacking the {@link Entity} will
     * be included in order of "priority of relation" to "attacking" the
     * entity. In short, if another {@link Entity} is considered a "team
     * member" to the attacking {@link Entity}, the "team member" may be a
     * second element within the {@link Cause}. The same can be said if an
     * {@link Arrow} was shot from a {@link Dispenser} that was triggered by a
     * {@link Player} flipping a switch.</p>
     *
     * <p>Continuing with the notion of "modifiers" to damage, the "base"
     * damage is modified or added onto after various unknown methods are
     * called or processed on the damage. Optimally, these modifiers can be
     * traced to a particular object, be it an {@link ItemStack},
     * {@link Difficulty}, or simply an {@link Attribute}. The interesting part
     * is that these "modifiers" do not just define a static value to add to
     * the "base" damage, they are usually a loose form of a {@link Function}
     * that are applied to the "base" damage. Given that {@link Cause} has a
     * unique capability of storing any and every {@link Object} willing to be
     * passed into it, we can easily represent these "sources" of "modifiers"
     * in a {@link Cause}. Now, knowing the "source" will not provide enough
     * information, so a {@link DamageModifierType} is provided with a
     * {@link DamageModifier} to paint the fullest picture of "explaining" the
     * {@link DamageModifier} as to why it is present, and why it is
     * "modifying" the "base" damage. Finally, we can associate a
     * {@link DamageModifier} with a {@link Function} that is passed the
     * current "damage" into {@link Function#apply(Object)}, being added to the
     * current "damage". After all {@link DamageModifier} {@link Function}s
     * are "applied", the overall "damage" is now the final damage to actually
     * throw a {@link DamageEntityEvent}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that due to the mechanics of the game, {@link DamageModifier}s
     * are always ordered in the order of which they apply their modifier onto
     * the "base" damage. The implementation for {@link #getFinalDamage()} can
     * be exemplified like so: <pre>{@code
     *  double damage = this.baseDamage;
     *  for (Map.Entry<DamageModifier, Function<? super Double, Double>> entry : this.modifierFunctions.entrySet()) {
     *   damage += checkNotNull(entry.getValue().apply(damage));
     *  }
     *  return damage;
     * }</pre> After which, the "final" damage is simply the summation of the
     * "base" damage and all "modified damage" for each {@link DamageModifier}
     * provided in this event.</p>
     *
     * <p>Coming forward, it is possible to further customize not only the
     * "base" damage, but override pre-existing {@link DamageModifier}
     * {@link Function}s by calling
     * {@link #setDamage(DamageModifier, Function)} at which point the
     * end result may be undefined. However, if a custom {@link DamageModifier}
     * that aims to alter the "final" damage based on some custom
     * circumstances, calling {@link #setDamage(DamageModifier, Function)} on a
     * <em>new</em> {@link DamageModifier} instance, easily created from the
     * {@link DamageModifierBuilder}, the provided pairing will be added at the
     * "end" of the list for "modifying" the "base" damage.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that this event is intended for processing incoming damage to
     * an {@link Entity} prior to any {@link DamageModifier}s associated with
     * the {@link #getTargetEntity()}. The {@link DamageEntityEvent} is used
     * to process the various {@link DamageModifier}s of which originate or are
     * associated with the targeted {@link Entity}.</p>
