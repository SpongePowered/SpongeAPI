/**
 * Represents the base event for when an {@link Entity} is being "attacked".
 * The uniqueness of this event is that all {@link DamageSource}s can deal
 * varying amounts of damage with varying modifiers based on various reasons.
 * Due to this ambiguous variety of information that is possible to provide,
 * the {@link DamageEntityEvent} can be summarized as so:
 *
 * <p>An {@link ArrowEntity},
 *  that was shot by a {@link Skeleton},
 *    with an enchanted {@link ItemTypes#BOW} {@link ItemStack},
 *  when the {@link World} {@link Difficulty} was set to
 *  {@link Difficulties#HARD},
 * will deal possibly "5" damage to any {@link Entity} it hits.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The issue with representing this type of "logic flow" is that a
 * particular amount of damage from a {@link DamageSource}, even if specified
 * to a particular {@link DamageType}, has no static finalized amount of damage
 * to deal to a particular {@link Entity}. To properly represent this,
 * a {@link DamageSource} has various "states" such as:
 * {@link DamageSource#isAbsolute()}, or {@link DamageSource#isBypassingArmor()}.
 * Quite simply, the {@link DamageSource} will always be the "first" element
 * within a {@link Cause} that can be retrieved from {@link #getCause()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Next, any additional "aides" in attacking the {@link Entity} will
 * be included in order of "priority of relation" to "attacking" the entity. In
 * short, if another {@link Entity} is considered a "team member" to the
 * attacking {@link Entity}, the "team member" may be a second element within
 * the {@link Cause}. The same can be said if an {@link ArrowEntity} was shot from
 * a {@link Dispenser} that was triggered by a {@link Player} flipping a
 * switch.</p>
 *
 * <p>Continuing with the notion of "modifiers" to damage, the "base" damage
 * is modified or added onto after various unknown methods are called or
 * processed on the damage. Optimally, these modifiers can be traced to a
 * particular object, be it an {@link ItemStack}, {@link Difficulty}, or
 * simply an an attribute. The interesting part is that these "modifiers"
 * do not just define a static value to add to the "base" damage, they
 * are usually a loose form of a {@link DamageFunction} that are applied to
 * the "base" damage. Given that {@link Cause} has a unique capability of
 * storing any and every {@link Object} willing to be passed into it, we
 * can easily represent these "sources" of "modifiers" in a {@link Cause}.
 * Now, knowning the "source" will not provide enough information, so a
 * {@link DamageModifierType} is provided with a {@link DamageModifier} to
 * paint the fullest picture of "explaining" the {@link DamageModifier} as to
 * why it is present, and why it is "modifying" the "base" damage. Finally,
 * we can associate a {@link DamageModifier} with a {@link DamageFunction} that is
 * passed the current "damage" into {@link DoubleUnaryOperator#applyAsDouble(double)}
 * , being added
 * to the current "damage". After all {@link DamageModifier} {@link DamageFunction}s
 * are "applied", the overall "damage" is now the final damage to actually
 * throw a {@link DamageEntityEvent}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that due to the mechanics of the game, {@link DamageModifier}s
 * are always ordered in the order of which they apply their modifier onto
 * the "base" damage. The implementation for {@link #getFinalDamage()} can be
 * exemplified like so:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code double damage = this.baseDamage;<br />for
 * (Map.Entry&lt;DamageModifier, Function&lt;? super Double, Double&gt;&gt;
 * entry : this.modifierFunctions.entrySet()) {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;damage +=
 * checkNotNull(entry.getValue().apply(damage));<br />}<br />return damage;
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>After which, the "final" damage is simply the summation of the
 * "base" damage and all "modified damage" for each {@link DamageModifier}
 * provided in this event.</p>
 *
 * <p>Coming forward, it is possible to further customize not only the "base"
 * damage, but override pre-existing {@link DamageModifier} {@link DamageFunction}s
 * by calling {@link #setDamage(DamageModifier, DoubleUnaryOperator)} at which point the
 * end result may be undefined. However, if a custom {@link DamageModifier}
 * that aims to alter the "final" damage based on some custom circumstances,
 * calling {@link #setDamage(DamageModifier, DoubleUnaryOperator)} on a <em>new</em>
 * {@link DamageModifier} instance, easily created from the
 * {@link org.spongepowered.api.event.cause.entity.damage.DamageModifier.Builder},
 * the provided pairing will be added at the
 * "end" of the list for "modifying" the "base" damage.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that this event is intended for processing incoming damage to
 * an {@link Entity} prior to any {@link DamageModifier}s associated with
 * the {@link #getEntity()}. The {@link DamageEntityEvent} is used
 * to process the various {@link DamageModifier}s of which originate or are
 * associated with the targeted {@link Entity}.</p>
