/**
 * A team on a scoreboard that has a common display theme and other
 * properties.
 *
 * <p>A team is comprised of different members, represented by {@link Text} objects.
 * While any {@link Text} can be added to a team, certain {@link Text}s convey a special
 * meaning.</p>
 *
 * <p>Examples of this include players, whose names gain the prefix and suffix
 * of the team they are on.</p>
 *
 * <p>With the exception of {@link #getNameTagVisibility()} (which is handled client-side),
 * all of the team options require players to have the same team object (and by
 * extension, the same scoreboard).
 *
 * For example, consider two players who each have different scoreboards set.
 * Each scoreboard has a team registered with identical names, each containing
 * the same players. Both players would always be able to attack each other,
 * regardless of the value of {@link #allowFriendlyFire()}.
 *
 * For it to work, both players must have the same scoreboard, and be on a team
 * registered to said scoreboard.</p>
