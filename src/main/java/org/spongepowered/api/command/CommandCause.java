/**
 * The {@link CommandCause} represents the {@link Cause} of a command, and
 * also contains utility methods to obtain key information about said cause.
 *
 * <p>In line with causes used in events, you may assume that the
 * {@link Cause#root()} (from {@link CommandCause#getCause()}) is the direct
 * invoker of the command, though it should also be noted that the invoker
 * and intended <strong>target</strong> of a command may be different, which
 * will be indicated by entries in the {@link Cause#getContext()}</p>
 *
 * <p>It is <em>very</em> important to note that no object in the {@link Cause}
 * is guaranteed to be a traditional "command source" - a plugin may invoke a
 * command without pushing anything to the cause stack and thus the
 * {@link PluginContainer} of the plugin in question will be the root of the
 * cause.</p>
 *
 * <p>In the case of a command being executed as a "proxy", such as a command
 * block executing a command by virtue of an entity stepping on a pressure
 * plate, the direct cause will be the command block. However, the player
 * in question will also be present in the cause stack, allowing command
 * providers to obtain richer information about the invocation of their command.
 * This is inline with how {@link Cause}s work in Sponge and its events, for
 * more information about how Causes work, see the {@link Cause} and
 * {@link CauseStackManager} javadocs and associated documentation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link EventContext} that is attached to {@link Cause#getContext()}
 * <strong>may</strong> offer other indications as to how the command should
 * be handled, in addition to using the provided cause stack:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link EventContextKeys#AUDIENCE}, which indicates the
 *     where messages that should be sent back to the invoker should be sent
 *     to (typically messages indicating the status of the command execution);
 *     </li>
 *     <li>{@link EventContextKeys#SUBJECT}, which indicates the subject that
 *     should be subjected to any permission checks;</li>
 *     <li>{@link EventContextKeys#LOCATION}, which indicates the location that
 *     the command should be assumed to be executed around;
 *     <li>{@link EventContextKeys#ROTATION}, which indicates the rotation that
 *     the command should assume the target has; and</li>
 *     <li>{@link EventContextKeys#BLOCK_TARGET}, which indicates the block that
 *     the command should take into account when executing.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This object acts as a {@link Subject}, and simply redirects all calls
 * inherited by this interface to the subject returned by {@link #getSubject()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>There are utility methods on this interface that provide hints as to what
 * the implementation will select for different tasks, for example, the
 * implementation will use the result of {@link #getSubject()} for permission
 * checks. Third party command consumers are under no obligation to use these
 * utility methods as all methods obtain their information from the
 * {@link Cause}.</p>
 *
 * <p>No method on this interface, apart from {@link #getCause()}, should
 * be taken a guarantee of what may be present, however, they indicate what
 * typically would be of interest to command API consumers.</p>
