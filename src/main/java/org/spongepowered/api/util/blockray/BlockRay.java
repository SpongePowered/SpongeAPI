/**
 * A block ray which traces a line and returns all block boundaries intersected in order,
 * starting from the start location. This class implements the {@link Iterator} interface
 * with the exception of {@link Iterator#remove()}.
 *
 * <p>Filters determine at what location a {@link BlockRay} should stop. A filter
 * is called at the boundary of each new location that a {@link BlockRay} passes through in order
 * to determine whether the ray cast should continue or terminate at that location.</p>
 *
 * <p>Any one instance of a {@link Predicate} should only be run on one path.
 * It is not specified that {@link Predicate}s have to be stateless, pure functions.
 * They are allowed to keep state along an individual path, based on the assertion that a
 * single instance is only called on one path.</p>
 *
 * <p>Filters are most useful for limiting the target block a player is looking
 * at based on some metric, like transparency, block model, or even distance. The standard
 * Bukkit-like behavior for finding the target block can be achieved with using
 * {@link BlockRay#ONLY_AIR_FILTER}, optionally combined with
 * {@link BlockRay#maxDistanceFilter(Vector3d, double)} to limit the target block to be within some
 * distance.</p>
 *
 * <p>To get the block targeted by an entity, use the following:
 * <pre>
 * {@code final Optional<BlockRayHit> block = BlockRay.from(entity).filter(BlockRay.ONLY_AIR_FILTER).end();}
 * </pre></p>

                z = d_z * t + p_z
            Where d is the direction vector, p the starting point and t is in |R.

            The block boundary grid can be modeled as an infinity of perpendicular planes
            on the x, y and z axes, on integer coordinates, spaced 1 unit away.

            Such a plane has an equation:
                A = n
            Where A is the axis label and n is in |Z

            The solution of the intersection between the above ray and such a plane is:
                n = d_A * t_s + p_A
                t_s = (n - p_A) / d_A

                z_s = d_z * t_s + p_z

            Where t_s is the solution parameter and x_s, y_s, z_s are the intersection coordinates.
            A small optimization is that x_A = n, which also helps with rounding errors.

            The iterator solves these equations and provides the solutions in increasing order with respect to t_s.
