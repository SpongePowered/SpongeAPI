/**
 * Represents a game "tick".
 *
 * <p>A game tick is a unit of work where the game processes the current state
 * and updates the game world and all the entities in it. It is not a true unit
 * of time, however, to ensure a consistent game play experience, each tick is
 * given a maximum processing time (which is generally interpreted to be the
 * expected duration of the tick, rather than the maximum) in which to complete
 * its work. If a tick takes less time than this allotted time, the rest of the
 * allocated time is unused and the engine simply waits for this time to elapse
 * before processing the work for the next tick - this gives rise to the idea of
 * a maximum <em>ticks per second</em>. However, if a tick takes longer than its
 * effective minimum duration, then the next tick must wait for the current tick
 * to finish before it can start. If multiple ticks take longer than this
 * processing time in a row, this will have the effect of reducing the number of
 * "ticks per second" that can run. At this point, the server may be considered
 * "overloaded" as it cannot keep up with the demand placed upon it and not
 * suffer from degradation in performance.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations <strong>may</strong> measure the duration of some in-game
 * mechanics using these server ticks. If this is the case, and the server is
 * overloaded, the increased tick time will result in such mechanics taking
 * longer to resolve. To complicate things further, implementations may choose
 * to "skip" ticks to reduce server load (so some mechanics due to run in two
 * tick's time may instead run in one tick's time). Thus, the use of a tick as
 * a time period is unreliable.</p>
 *
 * <p>For these reasons, consumers of this API should not treat a tick as a
 * fixed unit of time. Instead, ticks are an <em>intention of order</em>. A
 * mechanic due to resolve in two ticks will never resolve in a tick before a
 * mechanic that resolves in one tick (but again, due to tick skipping, they
 * may resolve on the same tick).</p>
 *
 * <p>Information about the current platform and {@link Engine Engine's}
 * expected tick rate can be determined by calling
 * {@link #single()#getExpectedDuration()}. The tick rate is not defined by the
 * API so may vary amongst different implementations. For all engines based on
 * vanilla Minecraft, this is 50ms for a 20 tick per second rate.</p>
 *
 * <p>While a tick is not a reliable measure of wall-clock time, implementations
 * may tie in-game world time to a given number of ticks. This object can thus
 * be used as an accurate <strong>in-game</strong> duration. However, it is not
 * defined in the API what the correlation between ticks and in-game time is,
 * again, this may vary amongst implementations. For vanilla Minecraft, 1000
 * ticks corresponds to one in-game hour, meaning there is <strong>not</strong>
 * an integer correspondence between an in-game minute or second and number of
 * ticks.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that this object does not hold any context about which {@link Engine}
 * the number of ticks was generated for. Consumers should use the methods on
 * this object to determine what this object would represent on the target
 * engine.</p>
