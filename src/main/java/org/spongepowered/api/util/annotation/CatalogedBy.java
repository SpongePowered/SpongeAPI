 * Annotates a {@link CatalogType} class to specify a set of special catalog
 * classes which act as the catalog for the annotated type. The annotated class
 * must extend {@link CatalogType}, and the specified catalog classes should be
 * queryable or otherwise serve constant instances of the cataloged type.
 *
 * <p>All Classes mentioned in the CatalogedBy annotation must meet the
 * following requirements:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The values served by catalog classes must remain the same and valid
 * at all times.</li>
 * <li>The variables in catalog classes may link to null if the given value is
 * no longer valid and no appropriate alternative can be found. If no
 * alternative could be found and if there probably won't be a new one in the
 * future then the field should be marked as deprecated and should be removed
 * after a grace period or with the next big release of minecraft, SpongeAPI or
 * the containing artifact.</li>
 * <li>It is possible for two or more different variables to link to the same
 * value. This includes both simple "well known" aliases and features that been
 * merged together or that were originally very similar and one has been
 * removed.</li>
 * <li>It is also possible that one or more values are not listed in the
 * catalog classes (Especially plugin or mod provided ones).</li>
