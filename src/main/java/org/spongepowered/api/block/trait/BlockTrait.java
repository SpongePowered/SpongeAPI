/**
 * Represents a possible trait in a {@link BlockType}s {@link BlockState}.
 * 
 * <p>A {@link BlockState} can include zero or more {@link BlockTrait}s. Each
 * {@link BlockTrait} within a {@link BlockState} is mapped to a value which
 * represents the current value at the time the {@link BlockState} was taken.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>For example, a {@link BlockTypes#BED} contains three possible
 * {@link BlockTrait}s :</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link EnumTraits#BED_FACING}</li>
 *     <li>{@link BooleanTraits#BED_OCCUPIED}</li>
 *     <li>{@link EnumTraits#BED_PART}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If you query a {@link BlockTypes#BED}'s {@link BlockTrait} you have two
 * possible outcomes for each {@link BlockTrait}. The
 * {@link BooleanTraits#BED_OCCUPIED} has the following possible values :</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li><code>true</code></li>
 *     <li><code>false</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>As 'OCCUPIED' is a {@link BooleanTrait}, it can only be <code>true</code>
 * or <code>false</code>.
 * The {@link EnumTraits#BED_PART} has the following possible values :</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li><code>HEAD</code></li>
 *     <li><code>FOOT</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>To determine the current value of a {@link BlockTrait}, you would call
 * {@link BlockState#getTraitValue(BlockTrait)}. To determine all possible
 * values of a {@link BlockTrait}, you would call
 * {@link BlockType#getTraits()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>As stated above, a {@link BlockType} may not always have one or more
 * {@link BlockTrait}s. An example of such a block is
 * {@link BlockTypes#BOOKSHELF}.</p>
