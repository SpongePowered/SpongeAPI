     * Applies the populator to the given chunk. The chunks at
     * {@code (chunkX + 1, chunkZ)}, {@code (chunkX, chunkZ + 1)} and
     * {@code (chunkX + 1, chunkZ + 1)} will at least have been generated
     * (although they do not have to be populated) to allow
     * {@link PopulatorObject}s to overlap across chunk boundaries.
     *
     * <p>This means that there are only four chunks guaranteed to be loaded.
     * Other chunks in the world may or may not be loaded. Avoid touching those
     * chunks, trying to get/set a block there may cause the chunk to be loaded,
     * which is a bad thing during terrain population.</p>
     *
     * <p>Those four chunks form an area of 32x32 columns that you can populate,
     * from {@code (block x, block z) (chunkX * 16, chunkZ * 16)} to
     * {@code (chunkX * 16 + 31, chunkZ * 16 + 31)}. See <b>Figure 1</b>. To
     * effectively use this area, it is recommend to make sure the centers of
     * all objects are placed from
     * {@code (block x, block z) (chunkX * 16 + 8, chunkZ * 16 + 8)} to
     * {@code (chunkX * 16 + 23, chunkZ * 16 + 23)}. This ensures both that
     * each object can extend 8 blocks on the x and z axis from its center and
     * that every area in the world is populated exactly once.</p>
