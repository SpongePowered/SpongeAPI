/**
 * An abstract implementation of a {@link Goal} that a {@link GoalExecutor} can run.
 *
 * <p>It is required for anyone wanting to write their own logic that a Goal can
 * run to utilize this class. If you desire to use the builtin AI included with
 * Minecraft, use {@link BuilderProvider#provide(Class)} and pass a builder to
 * it instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>At the beginning of every "AI" tick, all {@link Goal}s that are added to
 * the parent {@link GoalExecutor} are iterated through. If a {@link Goal} is already
 * marked as "in use", that goal's {@link #continueUpdating()} is checked for
 * {@code true}. If {@link #continueUpdating()} is {@code false}, {@link #reset()}
 * is invoked, and the {@link Goal} is "flagged" as unused for the parent {@link GoalExecutor}.
 * If {@link #continueUpdating()} is {@code true}, {@link #update()} is invoked
 * to perform any major logic.</p>
 *
 * <p>If an {@link Goal} is not currently flagged as "in use", then {@link #shouldUpdate()}
 * is invoked. If {@link #shouldUpdate()} is {@code true}, the {@link Goal} is
 * marked as "in use", and {@link #start()} is invoked. After {@link #start()}
 * is called, {@link #update()} will be invoked to be used for the first time
 * in this "AI tick".</p>
 *
 * <p>Regardless whether the {@link Goal} was "in use" or not, if the {@link Goal}
 * is now "in use", {@link #continueUpdating()} is called to verify the validity of the
 * task. If {@link #continueUpdating()} is {@code false}, {@link #reset()} is called
 * to clean up the {@link Goal}.</p>
