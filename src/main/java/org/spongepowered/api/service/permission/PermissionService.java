/**
 * Represents a provider of permissions data.
 *
 * <p>This is the interface that a permissions plugin must implement and
 * register to provide permissions for users on the server. Subject related
 * method calls on Players and Users are redirected to the active permission
 * service.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of PermissionService are expected to be thread-safe.</p>
 *
 * <p>Distinctions are made throughout the service between data which is
 * currently available, and data which may exist, but is not currently
 * loaded.</p>
 *
 * <p>Methods prefixed with "get" will typically only return data if it is
 * already loaded into memory. Methods prefixed with "load" however will load
 * data into memory if necessary.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link CompletableFuture}s are used throughout the service in situations
 * where it is possible that calls may take a considerable time to execute.
 * {@link CompletableFuture#thenAcceptAsync(Consumer, Executor)} can be used to
 * run a callback once the method has completed. Alternatively,
 * {@link CompletableFuture#join()} can be used, but care should be taken to
 * avoid blocking the server thread.</p>
