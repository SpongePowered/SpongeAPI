/**
 * A source of permission requests.
 *
 * <p>Authorization checks are made using "permission strings."
 *
 * <p>Permission strings are hierarchical with each level separated by periods
 * (full stops). An example of a valid permission string is {@code
 * example.function}. Inheritance is implicit; that is, if a subject has been
 * granted {@code example}, then the subject should have also be automatically
 * granted {@code example.function}, {@code example.another}, {@code
 * example.deeper.nesting}, and so on. However, implementations may allow
 * administrators to configure "negation" such that {@code example} and all
 * child levels would granted but {@code example.access} would denied (for
 * example).
 *
 * <p>Plugins may opt to implement "dynamic" permissions such as {@code
 * example.region.define.&lt;region&gt;} where {@code region} would be a
 * dynamically added level based on the context, though some attention should be
 * made towards the handling of periods / full stops in such cases.
 *
 * <p>Due to the implicit inheritance, it is recommended that commands that allow a
 * user to "apply" an effect to other users use {@code example.function.self} as
 * the permission for applying this effect to one's self. This allows
 * administrators to grant {@code example.function.self} to permit usage on
 * one's self and grant {@code example.function} to grant usage on other users.
 *
 * <p>Use a {@link PermissionService} to create instances.
