/**
 * A source of permission requests.
 *
 * <p>Authorization checks are made using "permission strings."</p>
 *
 * <p>Permission strings are hierarchical with each level separated
 * by periods (full stops). An example of a valid permission string is
 * {@code example.function}. Inheritance is implicit; that is,
 * if a subject has been granted {@code example}, then the subject
 * should have also be automatically granted
 * {@code example.function}, {@code example.another},
 * {@code example.deeper.nesting}, and so on. However, implementations
 * may allow administrators to configure "negation" such that
 * {@code example} and all child levels would granted but
 * {@code example.access} would denied (for example).</p>
 *
 * <p>Plugins may opt to implement "dynamic" permissions such as
 * {@code example.region.define.&lt;region&gt;} where {@code region}
 * would be a dynamically added level based on the context, though some
 * attention should be made towards the handling of periods / full stops
 * in such cases.</p>
 *
 * <p>Due to the implicit inheritance, it is recommended that
 * commands that allow a user to "apply" an effect to other users
 * use {@code example.function.self} as the permission for applying
 * this effect to one's self. This allows administrators to grant
 * {@code example.function.self} to permit usage on one's self
 * and grant {@code example.function} to grant usage on other users.</p>
 *
 * <p>Use a {@link PermissionService} to create instances.</p>
