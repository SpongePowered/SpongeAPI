 * Provides configuration for plugins.

 * <p>Plugins can choose between two places to store their configuration:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A shared configuration folder, which is preferred for plugins with
 *     little configuration. These plugins can simply use
 *     {@code plugin_id.conf}.</li>
 *     <li>A configuration folder specific for the plugin, which is preferred
 *     for plugins with a lot of configuration data.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In either case, a "default configuration file" is provided in both
 * scenarios. It is not required that plugins use this, but it does ensure
 * consistency.</p>
 *
 * <p>Call either {@link #getSharedConfig(Object)} or
 * {@link #getPluginConfig(Object)} to get an object that represents one of
 * the two outlined choices.</p>
