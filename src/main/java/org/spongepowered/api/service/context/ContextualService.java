 * <p>When functionality is provided to query data based upon a given
 * {@link Set} of {@link Context}s, the querying code must consider which of the
 * underlying data is "applicable" to the contexts specified in the query
 * request. It is expected that implementations will deem entries of underlying
 * data to be applicable if the {@link Set} of contexts defined in the query
 * contain all of the {@link Context}s required by the data entry.
 * Mathematically, an underlying data entry is "applicable" if
 * [the context of the entry] is a subset of [the context provided in the
 * query], or programmatically if [the context provided in the query]
 * {@link Set#containsAll(Collection)} of [the context of the entry].</p>
