/**
 * A {@link ComponentLike} that can be used in {@link Component} building methods
 * that represents a placeholder in text.
 *
 * <p>A {@link PlaceholderComponent} is the collection of a
 * {@link PlaceholderParser} along with contextual data in the supplied
 * {@link PlaceholderContext}, enabling its use in a {@link Component} object.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Such placeholders will generally be built from tokenized strings, however
 * these objects make no assumption about the format of text templating. Such a
 * system can therefore be used by other templating engines without conforming
 * to a particular standard.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link PlaceholderContext} is fixed when this object is created, but
 * {@link PlaceholderParser#parse(PlaceholderContext)} is not called until
 * {@link #asComponent()} is called. Thus, any {@link Component} object that is
 * created will reflect the time that the {@link Component} object was
 * requested, and not when this object itself was created. It therefore follows
 * that implementations must not cache the result of {@link #asComponent()}
 * unless it is known that the supplied parser is <strong>not</strong> sensitive
 * to the time of invocation.</p>
