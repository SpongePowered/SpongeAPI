/**
 * The abstract base interface for all of the "Value API". In short, a
 * {@link BaseValue} is a "wrapper" around an actual value from a
 * {@link ValueContainer}. The actual value may come from various sources of
 * the {@link ValueContainer}, but usually it's a generic dynamic system for
 * being able to fetch values from object fields without having to know the
 * type of {@link Class} of the {@link ValueContainer}, the getters and
 * setters for that particular value. The driving force behind this is that
 * instead of having a traditional hierarchical structure of data that is
 * possible to be retrieved from an {@link Entity}, {@link Living}, etc.,
 * all that is required is <pre>{@code container.supports(Keys.HEALTH) ?
 * container.get(Keys.HEALTH).get() : 0 }</pre> where the container is simply
 * a {@link ValueContainer}, nothing more, nothing less.
 *
 * <p>The advantage of this is that now, these various known and unkonwn
 * {@link Value}s can be retrieved by simple java generics:
 * {@link ValueContainer#getValue(Key)}. While having a {@link Value} for
 * something so primitive as the current health of a {@link Living} entity,
 * the power is weilded when a {@link Value} can be offered up to multiple
 * {@link ValueContainer}s without worrying about whether it's supported or not,
 * or getting the right cast information.</p>
 *
 * @param <E> The type of element wrapped by this value
