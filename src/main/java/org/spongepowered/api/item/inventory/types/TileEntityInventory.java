/**
 * An {@link org.spongepowered.api.item.inventory.Inventory} which is owned by a
 * {@link org.spongepowered.api.block.tile.TileEntity}. In Sponge, a TE is never seen as an Inventory itself and
 * Tile Entities are instead considered to "own" their own Inventory (much like
 * equipable entities do). Underlying implementations are of course completely
 * at liberty to return the TE object directly but as far as consumers are
 * concerned the TE instance and the inventory are separate things.
 *
 * <p>This is intented to provide a consistent way of dealing with inventories
 * regardless of the "owner" of the inventory. Thus, any code capable of dealing
 * with a {@link Carrier} is intrinsically able to deal with a TE inventory just
 * as they would with any Entity inventory or any other type of Carrier for that
 * matter.</p>
 *
 * <p>This separation of inventory logic from the TE itself also serves to
 * provide some flexibility for implementors, since it is possible that not all
 * implementations may take the view that a TE embodies its own inventory.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> Tile entity type, the specified TE must be a {@link Carrier}
