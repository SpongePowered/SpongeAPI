/**
 * Represents a generator to create {@link TradeOffer}s with a bit of randomization
 * based on {@link ItemStackGenerator}s for populating {@link ItemStack}s and
 * finally generating a {@link TradeOffer}.
 *
 * <p>The primary use of this, and why the {@link Random} must be provided as
 * part of the {@link Function} signature is that during multiple world instances,
 * there's different {@link Random} instances instantiated, and more can be provided
 * without the necessity to change the generator. One advantage to using a generator
 * is the ability to provide some "randomization" or "chance" on the various aspects
 * of the generated {@link TradeOffer} versus creating a static non-changing offer.
 * Normally, the vanilla {@link TradeOffer}s are using a similar generator with
 * limited scopes of what the {@link ItemStack} can be customized as.</p>
