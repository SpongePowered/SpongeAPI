## Prerequisites
* [Java] 8 (JDK 16 recommended for development)

## Clone
The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.  
1. `git clone https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI.git`  
2. `cd SpongeAPI`  
3. `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks`

## Building
__Note:__ If you do not have [Gradle] installed then use ./gradlew for Unix systems or Git Bash and gradlew.bat for Windows systems in place of any 'gradle' command.

In order to build SpongeAPI you simply need to run the `gradle` command. You can find the compiled JAR file in `./build/libs` labeled similarly to 'spongeapi-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar'.

Sponge will use a javac version of *at least* 11. If an older JDK is used to launch Gradle, JDK 11 will be downloaded automatically.
