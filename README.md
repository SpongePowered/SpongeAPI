# SpongeAPI [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI.png)](https://travis-ci.org/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI/)

SpongeAPI is the "API" portion of Sponge. It is a set of interfaces that plugins can build against so they can be run on a Sponge-compatible implementation. SpongeAPI cannot be run by itself as it does not implement the game or a server.

**NOTE: THE API IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS.**
